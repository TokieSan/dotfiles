# TokieSan: Dotfiles

My dot files (configurations). I usually do simple changes that aim to increase productivity and decrease bloatness. I'm using some shitty software that will be changed immediately after the foundation of a worthy alternative, or my laziness vanish and I start to improve some of the current available software or write my own.

There is no guide as everything is pretty clear, you'll figure it out.
